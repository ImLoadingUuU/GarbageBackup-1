Blueberry is a new system that allows you to ban/temporarily ban/issue account-based warnings for players who play your ROBLOX game. We all use moderation systems for our ROBLOX games. We all ban users from our game. Most moderation systems work with the basic kicking option: whenever a user joins the game, if their username or ID matches the data in the ban DataStore, they get kicked.

Blueberry’s purpose is to allow developers to display a ban screen instead of instantly kicking the player. Similar to ROBLOX’s website account ban/warning screen, Blueberry will show the reason for the punishment and allow the user to either accept and continue (for warnings) or log out (get instantly kicked) from the game. Blueberry allows you to replace the basic moderation (kicking) screen with a custom GUI.

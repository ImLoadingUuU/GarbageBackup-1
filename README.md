# blueberry
Blueberry’s purpose is to allow developers to display a ban screen instead of instantly kicking the player. Similar to ROBLOX’s website account ban/warning screen, Blueberry will show the reason for the punishment and allow the user to either accept and continue (for warnings) or log out (get instantly kicked) from the game.
